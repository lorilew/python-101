## Welcome to Python 101

This is a Python course for someone interested in becoming a professional programmer. It begins with thinking like a coder, progressing through the language of Python, to your first Pull Request. I hope you enjoy it! 

## Grades

Grades are just sign posts to help you make your journey to becoming a developer. They will give you skills that you can use to demonstate your experience to other people. Feel free to start where ever you feel comfortable. I will try to add fun and interesting problems to solve in each level and if you are higher level, try solve them in different ways using TDD.
